title: Test blog post
---

This is a test blog post, for testing purposes. The main things to test are:
* Markdown
* Code blocks
* LaTeX
* Images

# Markdown
In this paragraph, I want to test different stylings. This *word* should be italic, this **word** should be bold, and this ***word*** should be bold and italic. Below there is a quote:

> This is a quote.
Additionally, this [word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word) should be a link. Also, the following should be a mathematical expression $`\sqrt{1+x^2-\frac{1}{2}b}`$. Another mathematical expression:
```math
1+1=2
```

# Code blocks
Below, there are several examples of code blocks:

``python
def main():
    print("Hello World")
``

```gdscript
func process(delta: float) -> void:
    var x: int = 1
    var y: int = 2
    print_debug(x + y)
```

# Images

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
